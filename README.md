# My tmux Config

All the things I'm using to make tmux work for me!

## Essentials

- [oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) - Setup based on instructions from the repo. After following the guide, make sure to restart tmux (by killing the server with `kill-server`).

## Config

```bash
# config is in ~/.tmux/.conf.local
# edit it with your editor of choice
# to sync with tmux config:
# from the folder where oh-my-tmux is installed
cp .tmux/.tmux.conf.local .
```

Additions to Config:

```conf

```
